        "The Euclidean distance is the straight-line distance between two points in the Cartesian plane, also known as the L2 distance. It calculates the square root of the sum of the squared differences between the corresponding elements of the two vectors. In other words, it measures the magnitude of the vector joining two points.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Manhattan distance, also known as the L1 distance, is the sum of the absolute differences between the corresponding elements of the two vectors. It measures the distance between two points by adding up the distances traveled along each dimension.\n",

        "The difference between these two metrics can affect the performance of a KNN classifier or regressor in several ways.\n",
        "\n",
        "One possible effect is on the overall accuracy of the algorithm. The Euclidean distance is sensitive to outliers in the data, while the Manhattan distance is less sensitive to them. Therefore, if the data contains outliers, using the Manhattan distance may produce better results than the Euclidean distance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another possible effect is on the choice of the optimal value of K. In general, the Euclidean distance tends to perform better for lower-dimensional data, while the Manhattan distance tends to perform better for higher-dimensional data. This means that the optimal value of K may vary depending on the distance metric used.\n",

In contrast, Manhattan distance does not suffer from the curse of dimensionality and can be more effective in high-dimensional space.\n",

If the data has a mix of continuous and categorical features, other distance metrics such as Gower distance or Jaccard distance may be more appropriate. It is important to experiment with different distance metrics and choose the one that gives the best performance for the specific problem."
