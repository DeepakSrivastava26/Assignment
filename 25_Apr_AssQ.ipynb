It involves decomposing a matrix into its eigenvectors and eigenvalues. The eigenvectors represent the directions of maximum variation in the data, and the eigenvalues indicate the magnitude of this variation. Here are three specific applications or techniques that rely on Eigen-Decomposition:\n",

        "Principal Component Analysis (PCA): PCA is a widely used dimensionality reduction technique that relies on Eigen-Decomposition. It involves projecting high-dimensional data onto a lower-dimensional space while preserving the maximum amount of variance. This is achieved by computing the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix of the data and then selecting the top k eigenvectors that correspond to the largest eigenvalues. These eigenvectors form the principal components that capture the most important features of the data, allowing for a more efficient representation that can be used in subsequent analysis or modeling.\n",

It involves decomposing a matrix into three matrices: a left singular matrix, a diagonal matrix of singular values, and a right singular matrix. The singular values represent the magnitude of the variation captured by each singular vector, which corresponds to the eigenvectors of the matrix's covariance matrix. SVD has many applications in machine learning, including matrix approximation, image compression, and collaborative filtering.\n",

The resulting eigenvectors can be used to project the graph into a lower-dimensional space while preserving the local connectivity information. This technique is useful for applications such as community detection, anomaly detection, and visualization of high-dimensional data.\n",
