        "The basic idea behind gradient descent is to iteratively adjust the values of the model parameters in the opposite direction of the gradient of the objective function. The objective function represents the error or cost of the model, and the gradient represents the direction of the steepest ascent of the function at the current point. By taking steps in the opposite direction of the gradient, the algorithm moves towards the minimum of the function and eventually converges to the optimal values of the model parameters.\n",

        "The gradient descent algorithm starts with an initial guess for the values of the model parameters and iteratively updates the values based on the gradient of the objective function. In each iteration, the algorithm calculates the gradient of the objective function with respect to the model parameters and updates the parameters by taking a step in the opposite direction of the gradient. The size of the step is determined by the learning rate, which is a hyperparameter that controls the size of the updates.\n",

In batch gradient descent, the algorithm computes the gradient over the entire training dataset in each iteration, which can be computationally expensive for large datasets. In contrast, stochastic gradient descent computes the gradient on a randomly selected subset of the training data in each iteration, which can be more efficient and converge faster.\n",

        "Multiple linear regression is an extension of simple linear regression that allows for the analysis of the relationship between a dependent variable and two or more independent variables.

In simple linear regression, only one independent variable is used to predict the dependent variable, whereas in multiple linear regression, two or more independent variables are used to predict the dependent variable. As a result, the multiple linear regression model allows for a more complex analysis of the relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variables.\n",

In simple linear regression, the slope coefficient represents the change in the dependent variable for a unit change in the independent variable. In multiple linear regression, the interpretation of the coefficients depends on the other independent variables in the model. This means that the effect of one independent variable on the dependent variable may change when other independent variables are included in the model.\n",

        "Multicollinearity refers to the situation where two or more independent variables in a multiple linear regression model are highly correlated with each other. This can cause problems in the estimation of the regression coefficients and lead to unreliable or unstable results.\n",

        "Multicollinearity can arise when two or more independent variables are measuring similar concepts or when there is a linear relationship between them. In such cases, it becomes difficult to determine the individual effect of each independent variable on the dependent variable since the coefficients become unstable and have high variance. The issue with multicollinearity is that it inflates the standard error of the coefficient estimates and reduces their statistical significance, which leads to inaccurate and unstable predictions.\n",

High correlations among the independent variables are an indication of multicollinearity. Another way is to look at the variance inflation factor (VIF), which measures the degree to which the variance of the estimated coefficient is increased due to multicollinearity. A VIF value of 1 indicates no multicollinearity, while values greater than 1 indicate some degree of multicollinearity.\n",
