There are two types of hierarchical clustering algorithms - agglomerative and divisive. In agglomerative clustering, each observation starts as a separate cluster and then is successively merged with other clusters until all the observations belong to a single cluster. In divisive clustering, all the observations start in one cluster and are then successively split into smaller clusters.\n",

This process is repeated until the cluster centers converge.\n",
