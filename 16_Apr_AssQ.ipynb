        "Overfitting: Overfitting occurs when a model learns to perform well on the training data but fails to generalize to new, unseen data. This is because the model has learned the noise or random fluctuations in the training data, rather than the underlying patterns. Overfitting typically results in a model that has high accuracy on the training data but performs poorly on the validation or test data. Consequences of overfitting include poor generalization performance, increased sensitivity to noise in the data, and reduced model interpretability.\n",

        "Cross-Validation: Cross-validation is a technique where the data is split into multiple folds and the model is trained on different subsets of the data. This helps to get a more robust estimate of the model's performance and can help reduce overfitting.\n",
        "\n",
        "Early Stopping: Early stopping is a technique where the training process is stopped before it reaches the maximum number of epochs if the performance on a validation set starts to degrade.

        "\n",
        "The relationship between bias, variance, and model performance can be illustrated using a concept called the \"bias-variance decomposition.\" The expected prediction error of a model can be decomposed into three components: bias, variance, and irreducible error. The irreducible error is the inherent noise in the data that cannot be reduced by any model. The bias component represents the error introduced by the model's simplifying assumptions, and the variance component represents the error introduced by the model's sensitivity to changes in the training data.\n",
