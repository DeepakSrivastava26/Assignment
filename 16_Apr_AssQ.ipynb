        "Limitations of Boosting Techniques:\n",

        "Sensitivity to Outliers: Boosting is sensitive to outliers in the training data. A single outlier can influence the entire model and reduce its accuracy.\n",

        "Dependency on Data Quality: The effectiveness of boosting depends heavily on the quality and representativeness of the training data. If the training data is biased or incomplete, the model's performance may be compromised."
