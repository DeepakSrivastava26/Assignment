They directly impact how information flows through the network and affect the network's ability to learn complex patterns and generalize to new data. Here's how activation functions influence the training process and performance of a neural network:\n",

        "Non-Linearity and Expressiveness: Activation functions introduce non-linearity to the network, allowing it to learn and represent non-linear relationships in the data. Without non-linearity, the network would behave like a linear model and struggle to handle complex patterns. Activation functions enable neural networks to approximate any continuous function, providing them with great expressive power.\n",

        "Learning Speed: Different activation functions can influence the speed of learning during training. Activation functions like ReLU and its variants (Leaky ReLU, PReLU, etc.) tend to converge faster during training compared to activation functions like sigmoid or tanh. This is because ReLU-based activations allow for faster gradient propagation through the network, mitigating the vanishing gradient problem.\n",

        "Vanishing and Exploding Gradients: Certain activation functions can exacerbate or mitigate the vanishing and exploding gradient problems. Activation functions that saturate (e.g., sigmoid and tanh) tend to have gradients close to zero for large or small input values, leading to vanishing gradients. On the other hand, activation functions like ReLU are less likely to suffer from this issue.\n",

        "Dead Neurons: Some activation functions can cause neurons to become inactive during training, referred to as \"dead neurons.\" This occurs when the output of the neuron is consistently zero due to a large number of negative inputs. ReLU can suffer from this issue, but variants like Leaky ReLU and Parametric ReLU address it by allowing a small slope for negative inputs, preventing neurons from being entirely inactive.\n",
        "\n",
        "Output Range: The range of the activation function's output can also influence the network's performance. Activation functions that have a limited output range, such as sigmoid or tanh, can lead to saturation in certain layers, which hampers learning. In contrast, activation functions like ReLU and its variants have a larger output range, making them less prone to saturation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overfitting: The choice of activation function can influence the network's susceptibility to overfitting. Some activation functions (e.g., ReLU and its variants) have regularization properties that help in reducing overfitting.\n",

        "In summary, while both the sigmoid and tanh functions are used as activation functions, the tanh function is generally preferred over the sigmoid in hidden layers of neural networks because it is zero-centered and can model positive and negative values. However, the choice of activation function still depends on the specific problem and architecture, and newer activation functions like ReLU and its variants have gained popularity due to their improved performance in deep learning models."
