        "When dealing with a dataset that has a low percentage of occurrences of a rare event, you can use the following methods to balance the dataset and up-sample the minority class:\n",
        "\n",
        "Random oversampling: In this method, you randomly duplicate instances from the minority class until the dataset becomes balanced. However, this method may lead to overfitting and may not always be the best approach.\n",
        "\n",
        "Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE): As mentioned earlier, SMOTE can also be used to up-sample the minority class. SMOTE creates synthetic instances of the minority class by interpolating between existing instances, thus increasing the number of minority class instances while maintaining the distribution of the original data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Adaptive Synthetic Sampling (ADASYN): ADASYN is an extension of SMOTE that generates synthetic examples of the minority class in regions of the feature space where the class is underrepresented. This method can be particularly useful for datasets with complex distributions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Cluster-Based Over-sampling: This method is used to identify clusters of minority class instances and create synthetic instances in these clusters.\n",
        "\n",
        "Class-weighted loss function: Another approach is to use a class-weighted loss function during training. This approach assigns higher weights to the minority class, making the model focus more on correctly classifying the minority class, which is typically the class of interest.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ensemble methods: Ensemble methods, such as bagging and boosting, can also be used to balance the dataset. These methods combine multiple models to improve performance and can help in handling imbalanced datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "It's important to note that the best approach will depend on the specific characteristics of your dataset and the problem you're trying to solve. You may want to experiment with different methods to see which one works best for your particular case."
