Additionally, cost-sensitive metrics, such as cost-sensitive accuracy and expected cost, can be used to take into account the cost of misclassification. Finally, probabilistic metrics, such as log loss and Brier score, can be used to evaluate models that output probabilities rather than discrete predictions."
