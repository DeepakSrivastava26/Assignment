Prior to the introduction of the new product line, the store may have had consistent seasonal patterns each year, but afterwards, the seasonal patterns may become more or less pronounced, or shift to different months, depending on the popularity of the new product line.\n",

The ACF and PACF plots can show if there is a significant seasonal pattern in the data, and the number of lags can help determine the seasonality of the pattern. Additionally, seasonal decomposition techniques such as the seasonal decomposition of time series (STL) method can be used to identify seasonal patterns in the data. This method involves separating a time series into its trend, seasonal, and residual components, which can be visualized and analyzed to identify the presence and characteristics of seasonal patterns."
