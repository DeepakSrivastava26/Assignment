        "Hierarchical clustering is a clustering algorithm that groups similar data points into clusters based on their similarity. In hierarchical clustering, the data points are organized in a tree-like structure or hierarchy of clusters. There are two main types of hierarchical clustering:\n",

At each iteration, the algorithm produces a new, larger cluster until all data points are part of a single cluster.

By examining the dendrogram, one can visually identify the number of clusters that best fits the data. One can look for a level on the dendrogram where the distance between clusters starts to increase rapidly, which can indicate the optimal number of clusters. However, this method can be subjective, and the choice of the number of clusters can depend on the analyst's interpretation.\n",

        "Elbow method: The elbow method involves plotting the within-cluster sum of squares (WSS) against the number of clusters, and selecting the number of clusters where the rate of decrease in WSS starts to level off. The idea is to choose the number of clusters at the \"elbow\" of the plot, where adding more clusters does not significantly decrease the WSS. This method is commonly used in K-means clustering but can also be applied to hierarchical clustering.\n",
        "\n",
        "Silhouette method: The silhouette method involves calculating the silhouette coefficient for each data point, which measures how similar the point is to its own cluster compared to other clusters. The average silhouette coefficient can then be calculated for each number of clusters, and the number of clusters with the highest average silhouette coefficient is selected. This method can be used for both K-means and hierarchical clustering.\n",

        "Gap statistic: The gap statistic compares the within-cluster dispersion for the observed data to that of a reference dataset, such as a uniformly distributed dataset. The optimal number of clusters is selected based on the largest gap between the observed and expected within-cluster dispersion. This method is more computationally intensive than other methods, but it can provide more reliable results.\n",
