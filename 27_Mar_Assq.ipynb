However, many real-world problems have complex nonlinear relationships that cannot be captured by a linear model. In such cases, more complex models, such as decision trees or neural networks, may be more appropriate.\n",

However, when L1 regularization is used, some of the coefficients may be exactly zero, making it difficult to interpret the importance of these features. Additionally, regularized linear models may not be able to capture complex interactions between features, which can be important in some problems.\n",

        "Sensitivity to hyperparameters: Regularized linear models have hyperparameters that control the strength of the regularization. The optimal values of these hyperparameters depend on the specific problem and can be difficult to determine. If the hyperparameters are not chosen correctly, the model may overfit or underfit the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Outliers can be problematic: Regularized linear models assume that the data is normally distributed and that the outliers are rare. However, in some problems, outliers can be more common and have a large influence on the model. In such cases, other models, such as robust regression, may be more appropriate.\n",

For example, if one feature has a much larger range of values than the others, its coefficient may dominate the model.\n",
