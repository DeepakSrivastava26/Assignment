For example,let us examine the class Shape and its subclasses Rectangle and Circle defined in the script shape . Each of the subclasses Rectangle and Circle needs methods for computing area and perimeter. However, the procedure for computing area and perimeter would differ for Rectangle and Circle. Therefore, we define the classes Rectangle and Circle as subclasses of the class Shape. We define methods area and perimeter as abstract methods in the class Shape. The subclasses Rectangle and Circle override the methods area and perimeter by defining their implementation as shown in the program. If the subclasses Rectangle and Circle fail to override any of the methods area or perimeter, Python will yield a TypeError while instantiating them"
