By encoding data, it is possible to reduce the complexity of the data, while still retaining important information, making it easier to work with and to analyze. Moreover, encoding can help in avoiding bias while working with categorical data and ensures that data is in a suitable form to be used as input to different machine learning algorithms."

One of the input features in your dataset is the type of service a customer is subscribed to, which can be \"phone,\" \"internet,\" or \"TV.\" Since there is no natural ordering between these categories, you can use nominal encoding to transform this categorical variable into a numerical format. One way to do this is by using one-hot encoding, which would create three new columns in the dataset, one for each category. In this case, the column for \"phone\" would have a value of 1 for customers who are subscribed to phone service and 0 for all other customers. The same would apply to the columns for \"internet\" and \"TV.\" By using nominal encoding, you can now use this categorical variable as input to a machine learning model to predict customer churn."

These categories have an inherent ordering, with \"Less than high school\" being the lowest level of education and \"Doctoral degree\" being the highest. In this case, nominal encoding could be used to assign each category a numerical value based on its position in the ranking. For example, \"Less than high school\" could be assigned a value of 1, \"High school\" a value of 2, and so on up to \"Doctoral degree\", which could be assigned a value of 6.
