        "Lasso regression, also known as L1 regularization, is a type of linear regression that adds a penalty term to the loss function. The penalty term is the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients, multiplied by a tuning parameter that controls the strength of the penalty.\n",
        "\n",
        "Lasso regression is used for feature selection because it has the ability to shrink the coefficients of less important features to zero, effectively eliminating them from the model. This can help to reduce overfitting and improve the model's ability to generalize to new data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Compared to other regression techniques, such as ridge regression (L2 regularization) and elastic net regression (a combination of L1 and L2 regularization), Lasso regression has the advantage of producing sparse models with a small number of non-zero coefficients. In contrast, ridge regression tends to keep all features in the model with small coefficients, while elastic net strikes a balance between L1 and L2 regularization and can be useful when there are groups of correlated predictors.\n",
        "\n",
        "Lasso regression can also be interpreted as a method of constraint optimization, where the constraint is the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients. This makes it more robust to outliers and can handle multicollinearity better than other regression techniques. However, it is important to tune the regularization parameter carefully to avoid underfitting or overfitting the data."

On the other hand, if λ is too large, the model may underfit the data and have high bias, leading to poor predictive performance as well. Therefore, selecting an appropriate value of λ is critical to obtain a model that has good predictive performance and generalizes well to new data.\n",
