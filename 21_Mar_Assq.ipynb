For example, if we have the categories \"low\", \"medium\", and \"high\", we might assign them the values 1, 2, and 3, respectively. This type of encoding is useful when the categories have a natural order or hierarchy, such as in the case of levels of education (e.g. elementary, middle, high school, college).\n",

One of the features in your dataset is the customer's state of residence. You suspect that there may be a relationship between the customer's state and their likelihood to churn. Using Target Guided Ordinal Encoding, you can encode the state variable based on the target variable (churn) to capture this relationship and potentially improve the accuracy of your predictive model."

In statistical analysis, covariance is important because it helps to determine whether two variables are related and to what extent.

In contrast, if two variables are negatively correlated, then an increase in one variable tends to be associated with a decrease in the other variable.\n",
