        "Ridge Regression is a type of linear regression that is used when the data suffers from multicollinearity, which is a situation where the predictor variables are highly correlated. The goal of Ridge Regression is to reduce the impact of multicollinearity by adding a penalty term to the ordinary least squares (OLS) regression equation.\n",
        "\n",
        "The penalty term is determined by a hyperparameter called \"lambda\" (λ), which is a positive scalar that controls the amount of shrinkage applied to the regression coefficients. As λ increases, the magnitude of the coefficients decreases, which helps to reduce the impact of multicollinearity on the regression equation.\n",

        "In contrast, ordinary least squares regression (OLS) does not use a penalty term, but instead seeks to minimize the sum of the squared residuals between the predicted and actual values of the response variable.
