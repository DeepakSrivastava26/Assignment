        "The filter method is a feature selection technique that uses statistical measures to select a subset of features that are most relevant to the target variable. It works by evaluating each feature independently of the others, based on some statistical measure, and ranking them based on their scores. The top-ranked features are then selected as the most important features.\n",

It applies L1 regularization to the regression coefficients, which tends to shrink some coefficients to zero, effectively removing the corresponding features from the model.\n",

        "Decision Tree-based Methods: Decision trees can be used to perform feature selection by evaluating the importance of each feature in splitting the data at each node of the tree. Features that are less important can be pruned from the tree, effectively removing them from the model.\n",

        "Support Vector Machines: Support Vector Machines (SVM) can be used to perform feature selection by selecting the support vectors that are closest to the decision boundary.

Features that contribute less to the model's performance can be dropped from the model.\n",

        "\n",

This approach can overlook complex nonlinear relationships between variables that may be important for prediction.\n",

        "Limited to Unsupervised Learning: The Filter method is generally used for unsupervised learning problems, where the target variable is not available. It may not be effective for supervised learning problems, where the goal is to select features that are most relevant to the target variable.\n",
